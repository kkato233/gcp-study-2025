Professional Cloud Developer

Certification exam guide

A Professional Cloud Developer builds and deploys scalable, secure, and highly available
applications by using Google-recommended tools and best practices. This individual has
experience with cloud-native applications, Google Cloud APIs, developer and Al tools,
managed services, orchestration tools, serverless platforms, containerized applications, test
and deployment strategies, problem determination and resolution, and datastores. This
individual also has proficiency with at least one general-purpose programming language and
can instrument their code to produce metrics, logs, and traces.

Section 1: Designing highly scalable, available, and reliable cloud-native
applications (~36% of the exam)

11 Designing high-performing applications and APIs. Considerations include:

・ Choosing the appropriate platform based on the use case and requirements
(e.g. Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Run)

・ Building, refactoring, and deploying application containers to Cloud Run and
GKE

・ Understanding how Google Cloud services are geographically distributed (e.g.
latency, regional services, zonal services)

・ Configuring load balancers and applications for session affinity and performant
content delivery
Implementing caching solutions (e.g., Memorystore)
Creating and deploying APIs (e.g., HTTP REST, gRPC [Google Remote Procedure
Call)

・ Using application rate limiting, authentication, and observability (e.g., Apigee,
Cloud API Gateway)

・ Integrating applications using asynchronous or event-driven approaches (e.g.,
Eventarc, Pub/Sub)
Optimizing for cost and resource usage
Understanding data replication to support zonal and regional failover models
Using traffic splitting strategies (e.g., gradual rollouts, rollbacks, A/B testing) on a
new service on Cloud Run or GKE

・ Orchestrating application services with Workflows, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and
Cloud Scheduler
