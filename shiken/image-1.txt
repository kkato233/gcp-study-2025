ling secure applications. Considerations include:

Implementing data retention and organization policies (e.g., Cloud Storage
Object Lifecycle Management, Cloud Storage use and lock retention policies)
Using security mechanisms that identify vulnerabilities and protect services and
resources (eg., Identity-Aware Proxy [IAP], Web Security Scanner)

Responding to and resolving vulnerabilities, including those identified by Artifact
Analysis and Security Command Center

Storing, accessing, and rotating application secrets, credentials, and encryption
keys (e.9. Secret Manager, Cloud Key Management Service, Workload Identity
Federation)

Authenticating to Google Cloud services (e.g., Application Default Credentials,
JSON Web Token [JWT], OAuth 2.0, Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, AlloyDB Auth Proxy)
Managing and authenticating end-user accounts (e.9。 Identity Platform)
Securing cloud resources using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for
service accounts

Securing service-to-service communications (e.g., Cloud Service Mesh,
Kubernetes Network Policies)

Running services with least privileged access

Securing application artifacts using Binary Authorization

1.3 Storing and accessing data. Considerations include:

Section

Selecting the appropriate storage system based on the volume of data and
performance requirements

Designing appropriate schemas for structured databases (e.g., AlloyDB,
Spanner) and unstructured databases (e.g., Bigtable, Datastore)

Understanding the implications of eventual and strongly consistent replication of
AlloyDB, Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Spanner, and Cloud Storage

Creating signed URLs to grant access to Cloud Storage objects

Writing data to BigQuery for analytics and Al/ML workloads

: Building and testing applications (~23% of the exam)

21 Setting up your development environment. Considerations include:

Emulating Google Cloud services using the Google Cloud CL for local
application development and local unit testing

Using the Google Cloud console, Cloud SDK, Cloud Code, Gemini Cloud Assist,
Gemini Code Assist, Cloud Shell, and Cloud Workstations
